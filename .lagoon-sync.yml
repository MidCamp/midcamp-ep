# Below is your configuration for lagoon-sync.
# These data can live in either a separate .lagoon-sync.yml file
# or your .lagoon.yml file.

# If your project is on anything except the amazeeio cluster, which are the defaults
# and you're running lagoon-sync from a local container, you may have to set these variables
# you can grab this information from running the lagoon cli's "lagoon config list"
# this will output the ssh endpoints and ports you need.
# Typically, though, this information is also available in the environment variables
# LAGOON_CONFIG_SSH_HOST and LAGOON_CONFIG_SSH_PORT
#
# These, for instance, are the amazeeio defaults
# ssh: ssh.lagoon.amazeeio.cloud:32222
# api: https://api.lagoon.amazeeio.cloud/graphql
